I adapted OpenAI gym reinforcement learning framework into an algorithm that tries to learn what the user considers to be art, for a 100x100 pixels image.

You can read my thoughts on this project on my [blog](https://eviau.github.io/blog/IsItArtRL/isitartrl.html)

I have made a smaller version where the algo only learns the colour red, as a sanity check that the implemntation is working. Code can be given on demand :)

Next step: make it ~live~.
